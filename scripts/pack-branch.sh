# Pack a consumer-validation tarball whose filename carries the branch it was
# built from, and print the filename.
#
# `pnpm pack` names by version alone. Two branches sitting at the same version
# therefore produce the *same* filename in the *same* directory, so a consumer
# pinning `file:…/proposit-shared-0.52.0.tgz` installs whichever branch packed
# last — silently, because the version string still matches whatever the
# consumer verifies. That is the failure this exists to make impossible.
#
# It matters more with git worktrees, where several branches of this repo are
# checked out at once and all resolve `../proposit-shared/*.tgz` to this one
# directory.
#
# The branch also makes a stale pin legible: the consumer's `package.json` says
# which build it is pinned to, rather than a version that could mean anything.
